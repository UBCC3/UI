### Data Model

Data is either stored at a database (e.g. Postgres ) or in large files on AWS
S3, depending on data size.


## Information in a Database

Users table - "users"
   
  * username - an email address - unique key
  * last login - date/time
  * SSO authentication mechanism - enum : "google", "UBC" etc.
  * login count - how many times the user logged in

Jobs table - "jobs"

  * job ID - UUID, unique key. Eg. "978b13f7-4e8b-4944-aba8-647651bdddba"
  * job name - as entered by the user (string)
  * job submission date/time
  * username that submitted the job
  * job start time - first time the job has ran
  * job finish time - last time the jb has ran
  * job status - enum: "submitted", "running", "failed", "stopped", "done"
  * job parameter - JSON with all parameters needed for the job. E.g. basis set:
         {
               "basis_set": "STO-3G",
               "max_iteration" : 30
               "use_diis" : true
         }

Job Groups table "job_groups"
  * Group ID - UUID, unique key. 
  * username that owns the group
  * Group name as entered by the user (string)

Job-to-Job Groups table "job_groups"


  * job ID - UUID
  * group ID - UUID
  unique key is the combined two fields


## Large data in AWS S3

All information is in one bucket. Below it is assumed the bucket name is "ubcc3", and the job id is speccified by <job-id>,
which will be replaced by a UUID.

ubcc3/<job-id>/geometry.orig - geometry file of the job, in whatever format it was originally sent by the user
ubcc3/<job-id>/geometry.xyz - final geometry file of the job, converted to xyz, after all changes were made on the UI
ubcc3/<job-id>/core-hamiltonian.bin - core hamiltonian of the system
ubcc3/<job-id>/overlap.bin - overlap matrix of the system
ubcc3/<job-id>/initial-guess.bin - initial density guess
ubcc3/<job-id>/two-electron/- directory containing the parts of the two-electron integrals. File names are ERI_x_0_0_0_y_0_0_0.bin, where x and y are two indices between 0 and the number of basis functions.
ubcc3/<job-id>/fock-matrix/- directory containing the various fock matrices created while computing, in the format fock_matrix_n.bin , where n is the iteration number
ubcc3/<job-id>/densities/- directory containing the various densities matrices created while computing, in the format density_n.bin , where n is the iteration number
